# Welcome to Css-Fonts.css!

This is a css class meant to help you make the most incredible websites (etc.)...

Now, this class has:
	- Fonts
	- Loaders
	- Scrollers
	- Cursors
	- Css Objects (Parallax etc.)
	

__How do I include this in my project?__

Well, make sure you __download the CSSNAME.zip and extract it at the base of your project__ (next to index.html)
Then copy this to the end of your head tag:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="CSSNAME/connections.css" >
<link rel="stylesheet" href="CSSNAME/CSSNAME.css" >


__Notice!__

- Many css objects have large padding applied to them. In order to make sure they go to the next line softly, set your line-height property to be the same as your font-size. 
- For nav objects, adjust the padding to fit.
- If anything else does not fit, please check your object's properties.
